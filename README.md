# evacuation
Multiagent Evacuation Scenario in NetLogo.

This is a multiagent evacuation simulation for NetLogo.

Is very important to keep the structure of nodes and edges files. And they must be specified in the main screen.

Netlogo will generate the graph by reading this csv files in the set-up step.

Once the graph is created, we can run the simulation.

You can find other utilities in the extras folder, such as a preprocess-file program in python or a tool to play with fuzzy-sets.

The file social_forces.nlogo is an adapted implementation of the work made by Dirk Helbing and Péter Molnár in https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282
