Multiagent Evacuation Scenario in NetLogo and Python

This is a multiagent evacuation simulation for NetLogo.

The first step is to create the nodes and edges files.
Is very important to respect the structure of this files. And it have to be named nodes.csv and edges.csv

Netlogo will generate the graph by reading this csv files in the set-up.

Once the graph is created, we can run evacuation_scenario.nlogo in NetLogo.


You can find other utilities in the extras folder.
The file social_forces.nlogo is an adapted implementation of the work made by Dirk Helbing and Péter Molnár in https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282
